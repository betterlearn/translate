How to get the most from Machine Learning Books and Courses
如何充分利用机器学习书籍和课程

There are a lot of machine learning books and courses avaliable and a trend towards free university courses
and ebooks. With so much excellent resources avaliable it can feel overwhelming. So much so that it may prevent
you from getting started or making progress. 
可使用的机器学习书籍、课程有许多并且有些免费的大学课程和电子书。拥有如此多的可选择的极好的资源会让人不知所措。
资源是如此的丰富以至于可能阻止着你开始和进步。
In this post I want to share with you my tips for self study that allow me to touch a resource 
once, extract everything I think I can learn from that resource and integrate it into my own knowledge base so that I can make use of it going forward.
这篇博客中我会向你分享我的一些自学的建议，这些建议让我一遍过完资源后，获得我觉得我能够从资源中学到的所有东西并整合到我的知识仓库（knowledge base）中以便于我将来充分利用。
The knowledge base strategy and tactics I use were developed at university while competing
 a myraid of degrees and higer degrees. Although useful in a formal setting, I think they are 
 invaluable in self study enviroments where there is more pressure to be efficient with your time and resourcec.
我使用的知识库策略和战术是当初在大学学习直到读博都用到的。虽然在学校的时候是有用的，但是我认为在自学时特别是压力下高效利用你的时间和资源也是很有用的
Knowledge Base Strategy
Adopt a knowledge base strategy. A knowledge base strategy is a corpus of material you have created
 that support your memeory. You don`t have to remember the details of everything you have studied
 , just what you studied and where your notes are located.
 知识库策略
 运用知识库策略。知识库策略就是帮助你记忆的材料集。你不必记住所有学习过的东西，仅仅记的自己的所学和所记的笔记在哪里
 The kownledge base stratey requires that you create a directory on your computer or in the cloud. Under that
 directory you create a document for each course and book you complete or read that describes what you learned
 from that material and where to go to get more detail. For larger courses you may need to creat a subdirectory
 and a document for each week or module of the course and each assignment. The specific breakdown of directory 
 strcture and document is at you discretion.
 知识库策略需要你在电脑或者云上创建一个文件夹。在该文件夹下，你为学过的每个课程以及完成的书本或者读过的关于所学的以及得到更多细节的
 创建一个文档。对于一些量大的课程，你可能需要为每一周或者每一个模块创建子文件夹。文件夹结构的具体分类和文档有你自己决定。
 The principle is that you touch each resource once and process it thoroughly so that you can make best use of it again
 in the future as you need to. This typically means reading or consuming it and taking clear notes.
 (知识库的)原理就是你细致的一次过完每一项后你在未来需要的时候可以充分的利用起来。通常意味着细读并做好笔记。
Guide to Machine Learning Courses
机器学习课程的指南
Courses can have video, text, audio and in person components. You objective is to internalize the material you are exposed to from the course, associat
it to knwoledge you already possess and capture that understanding in summary form.
课程一般有个人的参与、讲座、课本、音频。你的目标是吸收内化掉你在课程中遇到的材料、联系自己已经掌握的知识并以表格的形式展现出理解。
Courses can also have additional reading and resources, as well as exams, tests, tutorials, exercises and assignments.
Within reasons, these resources must also be processing in a similiar manner. They are all just tools designed to help
you absorb the material and must exploit them to your benefit by integating the knowledge they expose into your knowledge
base
课程一般还有额外的阅读与资源和考试、测试、教程、练习、作业。在合理范围内，这些资源也必须是以相似的方式学习完。必须通过将材料中暴露出的
知识整合到你的知识库中来利用它们，从而为你带来好处。
Below are five tips for getting the most from a machine learning course.
以下是五项关于如何充分利用机器学习课程的建议
Regular Schedule
固定的时间表
Design a routine that you can complete the course work at a consistent and regular schedule. For example one hour a day every second
day or 8 hours every Saturday. Block the time out in advance and make a efficient use of the time.
设计出一项你可以定期并一致的时间表来完成课程的程序。比如说每两天一个小时或者每周六8小时。提前规划处时间并有效的利用时间。
Routine can get you a long way. When the scheduled time comes around you do not want to have to think about what you have to do in 
that time block. You must preallocate tasks in advance to avoid any overwhelm or over-thinking. At the end of each time block, 
allocate the tasks for the next time block so they are ready and waiting for you.
程序帮你坚持下去。安排好的时间来临后，你不必去想这块时间要去做什么。你必须提前分配任务避免任何的应接不暇或者过度的思考。
Your time estimates will be wrong by a factor of 2 or 4. Consider at least doubling the time you schedule or havling the workload
you pre-allocate to those times.
你所预估的时间将可能需要2到4倍。考虑至少翻倍你的时长或者减半分配时间段的任务量。
Create Lecture Notes
创建课程笔记
Courses are partitioned into modules or weeks or some similiar schedule. Each interval will have materials that you will be expected 
to internalize. It is very likely that course will have a summary of the material in the form of notes or lecture slides.
课程被分解成模块或者周或者一些类似的时刻表。课程的间隔间往往有要求你内化吸收的材料。课程很有可能会以笔记或者讲座幻灯片的形式总结的材料。
Create your own summary of the material for the interval from scratch. This will require that you take notes from the material that
you consume in the interval then break it down into a logical structure for summarization. This may be the same structure used to present
the material to you, but is more often than not different. it can be different because you will have associated the material to knowledge
you already have an can see a cleaner way to present the material  to your own mind than the way it was presented.
从头创建你自己的课程材料的总结。要求你从课程中的材料做笔记然后把材料分解成有逻辑的结构来方便总结。材料的逻辑结构可能和展示给你的材料的逻辑结构一样，但是
往往有所不同。它的不同是因为你将联系你已经学过的知识，与原本的方式相比，这样对于你的思考更加的清晰。
Aim for about a one page summary for each module or week of material. This will vary with the amount of content, but the objective is to 
summarize the material to the key concepts and a trail that links those concepts. Any detail you need on those concepts will be avaliable
in the original material such as lecture video or required reading.
对于每个模块或者每一个周的材料，以一页纸的总结为目标。这将依据内容的数量有所变化，但目标是总结关键的概念以及联系概念的途径。任何你需要的关于这些概念的细节
可以在诸如在讲座视频、阅读文本等原材料上找到。
